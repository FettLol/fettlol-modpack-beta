# Remaining Checklist

The following mods need to be added, updated, tweaked or in some other way adjusted before the modpack is ready for release.

## Thorium

`thorium = "https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ImUQFWcy/versions/1.2.1/thorium-1.2.1.jar"`

Thorium is disabled for now since there's a weird incompatibility with `spectrum`. This is not a blocker and can be fixed in a bugfix patch in the future.

## Miskatonic Mysteries

I want this mod to be added to the modpack before release, but the current state of the mod (as taken from build artifacts) is crashing on launch. It would be great to have this included on launch, but worst case scenario, it can be added later and just not be available in the various villages that have already been generated.

  miskatonic-mysteries = "https://brekitomasson.com/fettlol/mods/1.18/miskatonicmysteries-0.1.0.jar"
  trinkets = "https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/5aaWibi9/versions/3.3.1/trinkets-3.3.1.jar"


## Fettlol Utilmod / Fettlol Lib

I need to go through the various chests added by mods and datapacks to ensure that the loot hooks being added by `utilmod` are correctly adding things to the correct chests.
