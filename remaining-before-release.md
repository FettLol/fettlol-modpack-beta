# Remaining Checklist

The following mods need to be added, updated, tweaked or in some other way adjusted before the modpack is ready for release.

## Thorium

`thorium = "https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ImUQFWcy/versions/1.2.1/thorium-1.2.1.jar"`

Thorium is disabled for now since there's a weird incompatibility with `spectrum`.

## Miskatonic Mysteries

I want this mod to be added to the modpack before release, but the current state of the mod (as taken from build artifacts) is crashing on launch.

## Fettlol Utilmod / Fettlol Lib

I need to go through the various chests added by mods and datapacks to ensure that the loot hooks being added by `utilmod` are correctly adding things to the correct chests.
