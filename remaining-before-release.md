# Remaining Checklist

The following mods need to be added, updated, tweaked or in some other way adjusted before the modpack is ready for release.

## Miskatonic Mysteries

I want this mod to be added to the modpack before release, but the current state of the mod (as taken from build artifacts) is crashing on launch. It would be great to have this included on launch, but worst case scenario, it can be added later and just not be available in the various villages that have already been generated.
