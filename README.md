# The Fettlol Modpack

This is a Fabric modpack designed primarily for a multiplayer SMP server, but is fully playable in singleplayer mode as well. The core philosophy of the modpack is to stay as true to "Vanilla Minecraft" as possible in the early game, with a focus on adding more variation instead. Further down the line, in "endgame", there are additional mechanics available for players to explore, but these are mostly optional and primarily serve to give the player more things to explore.

# Installation

The only supported way of using this modpack is through the `minepkg` service. Install `minepkg` by following the instructions provided here: [https://preview.minepkg.io/docs/install](`https://preview.minepkg.io/docs/install`). Once you have done so, simply running `minepkg launch fettlol` should be enough to launch a Minecraft client with the Fettlol modpack configured for you. Connecting to the official server can be done using `minepkg join fett.lol`.

# Troubleshooting

## Before You Try Anything Else

First step if you're having any issues is to `minepkg selfupdate`, just in case. This modpack likes to be on the "bleeding edge" of functionality, so you might simply have run into a situation where the modpack requires functionality that has just been added to `minepkg`

## Low FPS

There is a known issue with the `create` mod that can cause dramatic decreases of FPS in certain situations. Before deciding that the modpack is simply "too heavy" for your computer, please type (while in game) `/flywheel engine` and test the three different alternatives provided there. Depending on how your computer is set up, the default alternative might not work well for you. We've seen examples of 10 FPS becoming 80 FPS by changing this setting.

# Inspiration and Philosophy

A big inspiration for this modpack comes from the Hermitcraft server. Partly in terms of what little they have done in the way of mods and datapacks, but also from the kinds of things they say that they wished were true during their videos. I've never been a fan of "heavilly modded" Minecraft, where you can hardly recognize the game any more, but I also think the base game can be a little too limiting at times.

The perfect compromise, in my mind, was a "Vanilla++" modpack, where most of the early game is exactly what you would expect, with most of the "modded" things appearing the further along you go. I also wanted there to be an emphasis on providing less more variations on what is already there (additional color variations on animals, more types of trees, more types of ores, and so on), rather than providing entirely new game mechanics, systems and/or enemies.

# Tweaks and Changes

> This section is a work in progress and will, when complete, contain a list of the various tweaks and changes made to Vanilla Minecraft. As the list of new features added with mods is too exensive, that will be covered elsewhere, if at all. For now, the following abbreviated list will suffice:

- Any flower can be duplicated with Bone Meal, not just "double high" flowers.
- Animals will eat food thrown onto the ground.
- Saplings and flowers will auto-plant themselves if on a Grass Block for long enough.
- Villager will follow players carrying an Emerald Block.
- Boats will no longer consider Lily Pads an obstacle.
- Witches will attempt to keep a distance from the player.
- Wither Skeletons
