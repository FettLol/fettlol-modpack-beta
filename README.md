# The Fettlol Modpack

This is a Fabric modpack designed primarily for a multiplayer SMP server, but is fully playable in singleplayer mode as well. The core philosophy of the modpack is to stay as true to "Vanilla Minecraft" as possible in the early game, with a focus on adding more variation instead. Further down the line, in "endgame", there are additional mechanics available for players to explore, but these are mostly optional and primarily serve to give the player more things to explore.

# Installation

The only supported way of using this modpack is through the `minepkg` service. Install `minepkg` by following the instructions provided here: [https://preview.minepkg.io/docs/install](`https://preview.minepkg.io/docs/install`). Once you have done so, simply running `minepkg launch fettlol` should be enough to launch a Minecraft client with the Fettlol modpack configured for you. Connecting to the official server can be done using `minepkg join fett.lol`.
