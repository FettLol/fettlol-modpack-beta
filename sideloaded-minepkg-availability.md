# Introduction

This document looks through the mods in `fettlol-beta` (soon to be merged into `fettlol` proper) to explore which "Sideloaded" mods are not currently available on minepkg. If a mod is available on minepkg, it will also indicate whether or not the mod available through minepkg is outdated and needs updating. Note also that since `fettlol` is a Minecraft 1.18.2 modpack, I am not looking at Modrinth or Curseforge mods for Minecraft 1.19, but only the highest currently released version compatible with Minecraft 1.18.2.

# Mods Obtained from Minepkg

Minepkg is, obviously, the preferred source for mods in `fettlol`. Unfortunately, however, this is not always easy as there are several mods missing from Minepkg, and there are a number of mods that are not being actively maintained or kept up to date.

# Mods Obtained from Modrinth

Modrinth is the second preferred source of mods in the `fettlol` modpack. This is because Modrinth allows you to hotlink directly to the JAR, saving me the trouble of needing to rehost the JAR file elsewhere. The following list explores the versions of mods on Modrinth versus minepkg.

> Note that, due to licensing issues, *some* of the mods marked "Not available on minepkg" may not be elegible on minepkg until we convince the developer themselves to upload and maintain it.

# Mods Obtained from Curseforge

Curseforge is, by far, the least favored place to get mods as it does not allow hotlinking directly to the JAR file, and their "Recently Updated" page has certain limitations that cause me to miss updates to mods at times. If any of these mods could be made available through minepkg (or, I suppose, Modrinth), I would quickly move to use that as a source instead.
